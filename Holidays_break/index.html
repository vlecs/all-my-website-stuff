            During the first week of break, my younger sister, younger brother, and I would sleep in until 10 am. We would wake up rested, ready to help prepare the nice breakfast together with my parents. After this, we would help clean up: wash the dishes, clean the table, put food away, sweep, etc. Once the kitchen was sparkling, we would sit down to watch a movie and play board games. We watched <em>Avatar</em> and <em>Avatar:The Way of Water</em> and followed with a quick game of UNO. Mosly, these first few days were a time to <strong>recover the sleep lost from the school days</strong> and spend the time with my immediate family that school nights don't allow.

            The day before Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, following our yearly tradition, we all gathered at my grandmother's house to help prepare for hosting. While the men cleaned and set tables, us women prepped and cooked the tamales and pozole for Christmas and the birria for New Years. <strong>After the food was set, we would go home to get ready and go to Mass in our best clothes, keeping what's important for our faith close.</strong> Afterwards, dinner and family time came, laughter and conversation filling the room. At 12:00 AM on Christmas Day, a hug and "Merry Christmas" exchanged between us all while a "Happy New Years" was greteed on New Year's Day. Overall, these days were resful and fun.
